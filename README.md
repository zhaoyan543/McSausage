## Section 1 Introduction

### What is McSausage about?
This application is a smart classroom setup. With this application, more energy will be saved as the lights in a classroom will be turned off automatically once there is no one detected in the room. In addition to that, our attendance taking system will also be more secured as students would not be able to ask their friends to help them take attendance. This is because each student needs to use their own NFIC card to tap in and pass the facial recognition, in order for the system to record their attendance. If the student is early or on time, a green light will be turned on, with an attendance of on time. If they are late, a yellow light will be turned on, with an attendance of late. However, if they turn up after the class has ended, a red light will appear and their attendance will be marked as absent. If they tap their card for a wrong classroom, the red light will appear as well as a text saying ‘You don’t belong in this class!’ will appear on the LCD. A live stream video of the classroom is also available for the lecturers to double check if there is anyone in the classroom remotely.
